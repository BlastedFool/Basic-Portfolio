                There are many things that I can tell about myself.
                <br> First off, I am a huge video game nerd.
                I love to play many video games in my spare time and it has always been a huge part of my life.
                <br><br>
                I even went to school to study game programming because games have just influenced a huge part 
                of my life. The first game I ever got to play was the Pokemon series. 
                I ended up growing up with Pokemon and it is my favourite game series. 
                I also love to play many other games such as League of legends, PUBG, Fortnite, and
                Black Desert Online.  
                <br><br>
                Oh before that I aspired to be a doctor, which long story short didn't end up happening. 
                My love for computers and technology just made much more sense to me to pursue in terms of a career. It is because of my love of videogames that my
                curiosity about other forms of technology grew. I do one day hope to become a Pokemon master as I
                said when I was a young child.  I would love to chase my dreams and even if I fail, I will
                continue to persist.
